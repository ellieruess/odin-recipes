        <p>Welcome to the landing page for <em>Ellie Eats Everything!</em> I am Ellie, a cooking enthusiast and coding amateur, and I am making this website of my favorite recipes as part of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Many of these recipes are shamelessly stolen from my favorite bloggers, so please be sure to check out the sources on each page with credit to the original creators.</strong></p>
