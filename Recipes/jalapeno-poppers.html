        <p>This recipe is slightly modified from <a href="https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/sweet-spicy-jalapeno-poppers/">this version from Taste of Home</a>. It's always a big hit at parties so I always make a double batch! Don't be fooled by the jalapeños--this recipe isn't spicy at all thanks to the cheese blend, but you can mix the seeds in with the filling if you'd like a stronger kick. These are also great with a pinch of cayenne pepper in the seasoning mix.</p>
